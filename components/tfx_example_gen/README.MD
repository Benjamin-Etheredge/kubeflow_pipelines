# Split Data (for Oxford Pet Data)
This module likley doesn't do much currently. I tweaked it too much when working with Siamese networks which required a different kind of splitting to the typical methods.

It needs modifications to allow the passing in of parameters for the which spliting methods to use. Or maybe this functionality should just be a different component. Either way, it's a latter kind of thing.
